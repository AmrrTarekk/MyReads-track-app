# MyReads Project

## Description
MyReads: A Book Tracking App which tracks your books and place them to one of three shelves (Currently Reading, Want To Read, and Read). 
It also searches for new books and gives you the ability to add them to your Reads. 
There's also a feature that makes you move any of these books ti any shelf you want. 

The Project is to:
* Break The UI Into A Component Hierarchy.

* Build The Dynamic Version in React.
* Add navigation.
* Use Debounce to Optimize the Project.
